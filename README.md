# odin-recipes
The goal of this project is to build a basic website for a recipe book. I will show intro skils for html ie, lists, images, bolding, capital, link, etcs.


forgot to have the different food items on different bullets/lines

Was just able to fix the images issue in the lasgnga fille, wasn't accesing the proper parent dictionary and photo was jpg not a png

Problem:
wings and poutine files will not open with the link.

Sol:
syntax error
